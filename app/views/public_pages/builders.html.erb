      <h2>Window furnishings influence buyer emotion and value</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      With over 10 years experience in the industry, we've seen it too often when you pour everything into creating beautiful homes,
      but leave out one small detail that makes a huge difference: window furnishings.
    </p>
    <p>
      We get it - Curtains can seem like an added cost, and sometimes they're the first to get cut. But here's the thing - Buyers don't
      just fall in love with a house, they connect with how it <em>feels</em>. And nothing brings warmth, softness, and emotion to a space
      quite like well-fitted sheer and blockout curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of it this way, you've already invested so much into your project. Why skip the finishing touch that will help your homes sell
      faster and for more! It's like baking the perfect cake and not bothering to decorate it. That final layer of finesse is what gets people hooked.
